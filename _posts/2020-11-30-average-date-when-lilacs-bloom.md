This GIS digital data set portrays the average date when lilacs start bloom in Idaho. Information on dates when plants and animals reach various stages in their development is referred to as phenological data. The purple common lilac (Syringa vulgaris L.) was chosen as the indicator of plant development in western regional phenological studies because it is well adapted and widely distributed throughout the Western United States. Approximately 160 observers scattered throughout Idaho observed the dates of lilac bloom for the 10 years of data used as a base for this study (from 1957 to 1966). Without the unselfish dedication of these volunteers this study would not have been possible.
