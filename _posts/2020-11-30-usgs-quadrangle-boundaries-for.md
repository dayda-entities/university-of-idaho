<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p><span>This data set portrays an index to the U.S Geological Survey (USGS) 3.75 minute digital orthophoto quadrangle images that cover Idaho. These boundaries are sometimes referred to quarter-quadrangles. The University of Idaho Library has at least one 1-meter orthophoto for each quadrangle. The data set was created by merging together source files from the USGS-Boise office and the Idaho Department of Water Resources.</span></p><p><span>Source data for this web service can be downloaded from <a href='https://insideidaho.org/data/ago/uofi/library/usgs_quandrangle_boundaries/usgs_quads_3pt75minute_id.zip' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>https://insideidaho.org/data/ago/uofi/library/usgs_quandrangle_boundaries/usgs_quads_3pt75minute_id.zip</a>.<br /></span></p></div></div></div>
